Medium-Level DSA Based Data Science Questions
Question 1: Clean the Dataset & Find the Most Frequent Category
You are given a list representing a categorical column from a dataset.
Some values are invalid (e.g., "?", "N/A", "None", ""). Your task is to clean the data
using loops and then find the most frequent valid category.
Input Example:
data = ["red", "blue", "?", "green", "blue", "", "N/A", "green", "blue"]
Requirements:
1. Create a new list that contains only valid categories.
2. Without using any library function like Counter, manually compute the frequency of each category.
3. Return the category with the highest frequency and its count.
Output Example:
Most Frequent Category: blue (3 times)

Question 2: Compute Moving Average (Window Size K)
You are given a list of numbers representing daily temperatures.
Your task is to manually compute the moving average for a given window size k
(without using NumPy or pandas).
Input Example:
temps = [30, 32, 31, 29, 28, 35, 36]
Requirements:
1. Use loops to compute the sum of every sliding window of size k.
2. Append each window's average to a list.
3. Return the list of moving averages.
Expected Output:
[31.0, 30.67, 29.33, 30.67, 33.0]

Python Data Science – DSA Worksheet
Difficulty: Medium–Easy
Focus Areas: Arrays, Dictionaries, Loops, Conditional Logic, Basic Statistics
Language: Python

Problem 1: Transaction Frequency Analyzer
You are given a list of customer transaction amounts (integers). Your task is to analyze the data
and identify the top 2 most frequent transaction amounts.
If two or more transaction amounts have the same frequency, return the smaller value first.
Input:
transactions = [200, 500, 200, 100, 500, 200, 100, 500, 500]
Output:
[500, 200]
Constraints:
• 1 ≤ length of list ≤ 10■
• Transaction amount ≥ 0
Expected Approach:
• Use a dictionary to count frequencies
• Sort based on frequency (descending) and value (ascending)
• Extract the top 2 elements

Problem 2: Missing Value Percentage Calculator
In a data science pipeline, missing values are often represented as None. Given a dataset
containing numerical values and None, calculate the percentage of missing values in the dataset.
Input:
data = [10, None, 20, 30, None, None, 40]
Output:
42.86
Explanation:
• Total values = 7
• Missing values = 3
 • Percentage = (3 / 7) × 100 = 42.86
Constraints:
• List will contain at least one element
• Use basic loops (do not use NumPy or Pandas)
